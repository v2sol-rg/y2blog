    "intro": "A website serves as a digital presence, reflecting the identity and narrative of its owner. For a design agency, it acts as a face, demonstrating our capabilities. A well-crafted website not only attracts the right clients but also brings in projects that align with our interests. Bearing this in mind, we initiated our website redesign by focusing on its core essence."
